# Teachmo Content Style Guide

## Voice & Tone
Teachmo's voice is **Supportive, Clear, and Professional**.
- **Supportive:** We are here to help parents and teachers, not judge them. Use "We suggest..." instead of "You should...".
- **Clear:** Avoid jargon. Use active voice. Keep sentences short.
- **Professional:** We handle sensitive child data. Reliability and privacy are paramount.

## Terminology Checklist

| Do Use | Don't Use | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Learner** / **Student** | Child / Kid | "Student" is preferred in academic contexts; "Learner" for growth features. |
| **Family** | Parents / Guardians | Inclusive of all home structures. |
| **Educator** / **Teacher** | Faculty | "Teacher" is the primary role. |
| **Activity** | Task / Chore | Something a student does. |
| **Message** | DM / Chat | Communications between family and school. |
| **Weekly Brief** | Newsletter | The personalized summary generated by AI. |
| **Organization** | Tenant / Account | The district or school entity. |

## UI Text Patterns

### Buttons
- Use **Action + Object** patterns (e.g., "Save Profile", "Send Message").
- Avoid generic "OK" or "Submit" where possible.

### Error Messages
- **Bad:** "An error occurred."
- **Good:** "We couldn't save your changes. Please check your connection and try again."
- Always offer a path forward (try again, contact support).

### Empty States
- Explain *why* it's empty.
- Provide a button to *fill* it.
- Example: "No assignments yet. Connect Google Classroom to see student work here."
